This is an example to upload data to the Weather Underground. The code
is purely for educational purpose. No guarantee that it is 100% correct.

After you build the code and upload it to a SODAQ board the program will
start by reading the wunderground parameters.

The program uses Serial for this.

At the prompt you can type any of the following commands (see the code for
more details):
 id=<some pws id>
 pw=<the pws password>
 ts=<the current timestamp>
 tb=<the interval for uploading>

After the parameters are entered you must enter "ok" to start the program.
It will be better to disconnect the USB because it may interfere with the
GPRSbee which is also connected to Serial.
